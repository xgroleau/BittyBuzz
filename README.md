# What is BittyBuzz?

BittyBuzz is an implementation of the
[Buzz programming language](http://the.swarming.buzz) for
microcrontrollers. BittyBuzz is designed to fit a 32k flash memory and
work with as little as 2k of RAM.

While the BittyBuzz VM has a number of limitations with respect to the
original Buzz VM, BittyBuzz supports 100% of the Buzz bytecode.

# Compiling BittyBuzz

## For your PC

Type these commands:

    $ cd bittybuzz
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../src/
    $ make

## For the Kilobot

To compile BittyBuzz to an .hex file that can be used with the
Kilobot, you need `avr-gcc` and related tools. `avr-gcc` is expected to be
installed under `/usr/lib/avr/` so that CMake may find its header files.

Type these commands:

    $ cd bittybuzz
    $ mkdir build_kilobot
    $ cd build_kilobot
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../src/cmake/Kilobot.cmake ../src/
    $ make

# Generating documentation

A good place to get started with BittyBuzz is the source code documentation.
One may optionaly create such Doxygen-generated documentation of BittyBuzz.
This requires [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) and can be done via:

    $ make doc

The documentation will be subsequently available in HTML and LaTeX formats
under `<build_dir>/doc`, for example, `build/doc`.

# Writing your own behaviors

## For kilobots

Currently, BittyBuzz does not support global installation. Behaviors must thus be
implemented under `src/kilobot/behaviors` directly.

The C source file should be placed inside `src/<robot_name>/behaviors`,
whereas the Buzz script is expected to have the same name and be
placed under `src/<robot_name>/behaviors/buzz_scripts`. You should also place a
Buzz String Table (`.bst`) file (which allows BittyBuzz to generate a
string ID corresponding to each string) next to your Buzz script, which
should contain any string used within the C code and that does not appear
in the Buzz script. Look at existing files if you are unsure.

_EDIT: It is no longer required to put any thing in the `.bst` file. However, the file itself is still required to be there. It will eventualy become optional._

At this point, you may run `make` inside your kilobot build directory to
generate a HEX file that can be sent to the kilobots. You will find it
under `<build_dir>/kilobot/behaviors/<buzz_script_name>/<buzz_script_name>.hex`.
This file can be sent to the kilobots using the
[KiloGUI](https://www.kilobotics.com/download).

_Important:_ After adding new files, be sure to run `cmake ../src` inside
your kilobot build directory for CMake to take them into account.

## Options

It is possible to specify a custom value for a range of configuration values.
Behaviors on low-resource robots often require parameter-tweaking. However, we
recommend against changing these values unless it is necessary.

The table below describes all configurable values and classifies each one by
the likelihood that one will require changing it.
